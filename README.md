## How it should looks like
* I am building a meeting scheduler application for one meeting room.
* My application have two screens: “Calendar” screen and “Create event” screen;
* “Calendar” screen consists of a pre-defined table with 5 days (Mon-Fri) for columns and 9 time slots (10:00-18:00, one hour long each) for rows;
* There is a team of several people that can take part in the meetings (I can hardcode the list of team member in my code).
* One meeting can take only 1 hour and obtain one cell in the “Calendar” screen;

## Basic feature
* On a “Calendar” screen user should be able to see all meetings scheduled for the meeting room;
* User should be able to filter meetings by person;
* In order to create new meeting user should click “New Event+” button at “Calendar” screen, after that he should be transferred to “Create event” screen. At that  * Screen user should enter meeting title, select participants (can be multiple), select day (Mon-Fri), select time (10:00-18:00);
* The meeting can be successfully created if and only if the time slot for that day and time is free. Otherwise the error bar should be shown.
* After successful creation of an event, the user should be transferred back to the “Calendar” screen where new event should already be displayed.
* In order to delete a meeting user has to click the delete icon near the meeting title at “Calendar” screen and then confirm his action in a confirmation dialog.
